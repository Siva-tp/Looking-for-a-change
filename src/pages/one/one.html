            Mother Teresa
            </ion-card-title>
          <p>  <br>            "Peace begins with a smile.."
            <br>  <br>

            Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.

            <br>  <br>
            If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.

            <br>  <br>
            There are no great things, only small things with great love. Happy are those.

            <br>  <br>
            If you judge people, you have no time to love them.
            <br>  <br>

            Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love.
            <br>  <br>

            I'm a little pencil in the hand of a writing God, who is sending a love letter to the world.

            <br>  <br>
            Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.

            Gautama Buddha
            </ion-card-title>
          <p>
            The mind is everything. What you think you become.
            <br><br>
            Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth.
            <br><br>
            We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.
            <br><br>
            All that we are is the result of what we have thought.
            <br><br>
            You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.
            <br><br>    
             Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.
            <br><br>   
            Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.
            <br><br> 
           Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship.
           <br><br> 
           We are what we think. All that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts, we make the world.
          You only lose what you cling to.

                <p>
                    Imagination is more important than knowledge.
                    <br><br>
                    Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.
                    <br><br>
                    Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.
                    <br><br>
                    I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.
                    <br><br>
                    Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
                    <br><br>
                    Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.
                    <br><br>
                    The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.
                    <br><br>
                    There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.
                    <br><br>
                    Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.
                    <br><br>
                    Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.

                Stay hungry stay foolish.
                <br><br>
                I want to put a ding in the universe.
                <br><br>
                Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
                <br><br>
                We hire people who want to make the best things in the world.
                <br><br>
                Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.
                <br><br>
                Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.
                <br><br>
                Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters to me.
                <br><br>
                Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected.
                <br><br>
                Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.
                <br><br>
                You can't just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they'll want something new.
                <br><br>
                It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.

                 <p>
                    Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
                    <br><br>
                    When once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.
                    <br><br>
                    Learning never exhausts the mind.
                    <br><br>
                     Art is never finished, only abandoned.
                     <br><br>
                     Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen.
                     <br><br>
                     The human foot is a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art.
                     <br><br>
                     It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things.
                     <br><br>
                     I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.
                     <br><br>
                     As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death.
                     <br><br>
                     Water is the driving force of all nature.

                 </ion-card-title>
                 <p>
                    When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.
                    <br><br>
                    Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.
                    <br><br>
                    There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.
                    <br><br>
                    So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.
                    <br><br>
                    Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dream.
                    <br><br>
                    One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.
                    <br><br>
                    Don't waste your time with explanations: people only hear what they want to hear.
                    <br><br>
                    Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worst kind of suffering.
                    <br><br>
                    Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure.
                    <br><br>
                    You drown not by falling into a river, but by staying submerged in it.

                     </ion-card-title>
                     <p>
                        Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.
                        <br><br>
                        My religion is very simple. My religion is kindness.
                        <br><br>
                        Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive.
                        <br><br>
                        Sleep is the best meditation.
                        <br><br>
                       Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
                       <br><br>
                       If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.
                       <br><br>
                       Remember that sometimes not getting what you want is a wonderful stroke of luck.
                       <br><br> 
                       This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness.
                       <br><br> 
                       Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.
                       <br><br>
                       The purpose of our lives is to be happy.

                         <p>
                            The wound is the place where the Light enters you.
                            <br><br>
                            Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field. I'll meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about.
                            <br><br>
                            Let the beauty we love be what we do.
                            <br><br>
                            Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.
                            <br><br>
                            Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along.
                            <br><br>
                            Only from the heart can you touch the sky.
                            <br><br>
                            Let yourself be silently drawn by the stronger pull of what you really love.
                            <br><br>
                            Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment.
                            <br><br>
                            When you do things from your soul, you feel a river moving in you, a joy.
                            <br><br>
                            The cure for pain is in the pain.
